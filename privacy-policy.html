      <h2>2. Information We Collect &amp; Why</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Local Game Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Words guessed, wins, streaks, haptics and other in-game stats.</li>
        <li><em>Purpose:</em> provide gameplay features, achievements and preferences.</li>
        <li><em>Storage:</em> <strong>only on your device</strong>; not transmitted to us.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We use Google’s Families Self-Certified Ads SDK (AdMob) to show <strong>non-personalized</strong>, <strong>G-rated</strong> ads only.</li>
        <li>All ad requests are tagged <code>tagForChildDirectedTreatment(true)</code> and <code>tagForUnderAgeOfConsent(true)</code>.</li>
        <li>Google may receive a resettable <strong>Advertising ID</strong>, coarse device/OS info and your IP address to deliver, measure and protect against fraud/abuse. This can reveal <strong>approximate location</strong> (city/region level) for safety and compliance purposes.</li>
        <li>Ad processing is governed by the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics &amp; Performance)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics (Firebase Analytics):</strong> anonymous usage events (e.g., screens, taps, session counts) to understand usage and improve the app. We do <strong>not</strong> set a user ID or use data for personalized advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reporting (Firebase Crashlytics):</strong> crash traces, diagnostics, device/OS/app version to find and fix problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Monitoring (Firebase Performance):</strong> timing and network performance metrics to keep the app fast and reliable.</li>
        <li><em>Controls:</em> where required by law (e.g., EEA/UK), we minimize identifiers and obtain consent or rely on another lawful basis as described below. You may also request we disable analytics/crash/performance for your device by emailing us.</li>
        <li>Data is processed by Google Firebase under their product-specific terms and privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 In-App Purchases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchases (e.g., ad removal) are handled by Google Play / Apple App Store. We do not receive payment card data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5 Device Permissions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vibration</strong> (haptics) and <strong>Internet</strong> (ads, updates, purchase verification).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.6 Data We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No account registration, names, emails (except if you email us).</li>
        <li>No precise geolocation, contacts, photos, microphone or camera.</li>
        <li>No sensitive personal data (e.g., health, biometrics).</li>
